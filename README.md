# Time Tracker

This is a simple Python script to store the current time as start/end time and calculate the difference in hours by clicking on the batch-file.

There's also a custom shortcut with a clock icon and that is set to minimized window and can be placed anywhere. The minimized window prevents a cmd window to pop up and wait for a manual close.

A manual installation of win10toast is required to use the script.
```bash
pip install win10toast
```
