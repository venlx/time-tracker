# Time Tracker

This is a simple Python script to store the current time as start/end time and calculate the difference in hours by simply clicking on the batch-file.

Theres also a custom shortcut with a clock icon and a minimized window that can be placed anywhere. The minimized window prevents a cmd window to pop up and wait for a manual close.
